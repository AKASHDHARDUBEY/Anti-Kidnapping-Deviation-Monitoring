Ride-Share "Intent" Detection (Anti-Kidnapping & Deviation Monitoring)
Problem: Women in ride-shares often realize they are being kidnapped only after the driver has already deviated significantly or reached a secluded area, making it too late to call for help.
Build a solution Design a real-time background service that monitors GPS data against expected routes and driver behavior (stops/speed) to autonomously detect kidnapping intent without requiring manual user intervention.
Expected Output: A mobile application module that triggers a "Silent Dispatch" of live coordinates to authorities if the vehicle deviates from the safe corridor or stops in a high-risk zone for too long.
Real world angle: This shifts safety tech from "panic buttons" (which require the victim to act) to "passive monitoring" (which works even if the victim is frozen in fear or threatened).
